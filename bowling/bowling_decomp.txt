Spend the next 5 minutes decomposing the following problem (just decompose the problem, do not write any code to actually solve the problem for now):
Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should have two methods: roll which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and score which is called at the end and returns the total game score.

Array to track the score of a game
Method "roll" that starts by printing the current score
Have the method take in the number of pins knocked down and print that

Add the number of pins knocked down to the score array (as a start)

Add calculations to figure out the score to add (multiple steps), based on number of pins
Repeat ten (20 times for full game) times for each frame of bowling (loop)
    p score to test
    Count which frame you're on
  Each frame has 1-2 rolls (loop or if?)
    Count how many pins are still standing (if any)
    If any, roll again.

Method "score" that prints the score
  takes score array, adds together and prints
